On the 26th 'of January 1857, the Master of the Rolls
submitted to the Treasury aproposal for the publication

of materials for the History of this Country from the
Invasion of the Romans to the Reign of Henry VIII.

The Master of the Rolls suggested that these materiale
should be selected for publication under competent editors
without reference to periodical or chronological arrange·
ment, without mutilation or abridgment, preference being
given, in the first instance, to such materials as were most
scarae and valueble. .

He proposed that each chronicle or historical document
to be edited should be treated in the same way as if the
editor were engaged on an Editio Princeps3 and for this
purpose the most correct text should be formed from an
accurate collation of the best MSS.

To render the work more generally useful, the Mester
of the Rolls suggested that the editor should give en
account of the MSS. employed by him, of their ege and
their peculiarities3 that he should add to the work a brief
account of the life end times of the author, and any
remarks necessary to explain the chronology3 but no other
note or comment was to be allowed, except what might be
necessary to establish the correctness of the text.
