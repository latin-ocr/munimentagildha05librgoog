literally “marked it for his own.” In the first fly'leaffflffl‘ffi

of the Guildhall Volume, wa find written, in 0⁰li0n'sslt‘lflss3, or

hand, - a convincing proof that the “ boke newly amma

“ bound,'’ really did contain part of the former· Liber {ssffl'g

Onstuuaorum and part of the Liber Legum 'Rapum mssa,

deligatorum—the words, “Liber Ousfwmurum ia torthse-
“ porte, Liber Rapum Antiquarum ia porte ;’' besides mh*
which, the titles of its varied contenta are far from
¹sparsely inserted in Cotton's writing throughout the

work

ln addition to his singular spirit of acquisitiveness, samam
in reference to books and manuscripts, which, wilhill'pa

speak in the mildest terms, seems to have carried him gymno

to somewhat unreasonable lengths‚ Cotton was pos- ’ΝΜ
sessed by another furor, which, in hia case, we might
be almost justified in looking uponas a falling “ to
“ madness near allied.” James the First, unfortu-
nately, was ²“ frequently wont to do him the honour
“ of calling him coustra;’' and this, on the somawhat
slender ground, that Cotton's great-great-grandmother,
on tha father's side, was lineally descended from the
second son of Robert Bruce, lord of Annandale, and
Isabella, daughter of David, second Earl of Hunting-
don; from which same Robert and Isabella the royal
family of Scotland was also descended. For this naussum»

reason it was, that sir Robert assumed the habit of iihihih⁰

writing his name ¹‘ Robert Cotton-Bruce,'' and learned 8οῶῗῖ
to luxuriata tc extravaganoa in all the pomp of
heraldio quarterings and blazonry. And hence it is, fflffigw
that the commenoing page of the Guildhall Liber Oua-fflffl.
tomorum which, as already observed, he had un· ffissglffi
doubtedly taught himself to believe was his own,

now bears two gorgeous blazons, in argent and ull

colours proper, of tha multifarious quarterings of the

'In folio Ι. a, for example, and ²Hearne’s Collecfioa of aava
about ten other instanter. Dircoursea ii. p. ⁴29 (ed. 177³).
